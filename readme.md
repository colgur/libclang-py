libclang-py
===========
A Python Extension project leveraging the [clang](http://clang.llvm.org) c-api.

Some Notes
----------
This repo (like most of my repos) exists primarily to back-up work. Shoot me an email if you actually want to use any of it.

You should be aware of [the official libclang Python Binding](http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/bindings/python/). I ran into [some problems](http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=9275) with it. Problems aside, this project is more about experimenting with Python extensions and the C-API.

Branches in this project follow the [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) pattern. The branching strategy described in Vincent Driessen's [blog post](http://nvie.com/git-model) really resonated with me.
